# This file contains definitions for valid strokes for KMouseTool
# To make sense of the numbers: 
# The mouse path begins and ends when the mouse is paused.
# Imagine a square enclosing the path.
# Divide the square into 9 boxes, and number them like so:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9
# 
# The mouse path can then be described by a sequence of numbers:
# for example, "12321" describes the mouse moving from left to right and back.
# This general scheme follows libstroke (http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/)
# although it was reimplemented from scratch for KMouseTool.

# For each stroke recognized, provide an integer describing an action
# KMouseTool can take.  At the moment, valid actions are:
# -1     Do not click
#  1     Normal click (use Smart Drag if that's enabled)
#  2     Right  click
#  3     Double click
